# register()

`ajax.register(config)` is the main API. Call it once per interaction type —
each call wires up event listeners and teaches Ajax what to fetch and swap.

```js
import ajax from "@erikt/ajax"

ajax.register({
  target: "#link-about",
  swaps: [{ replace: "#main" }],
})
```

Ajax observes the DOM, so elements matching `target` that are added after the
call is made are picked up automatically.

---

## AjaxConfig

### `target`

```ts
target: string
```

A CSS selector for the element(s) that trigger requests. Every element in the
document matching this selector gets an event listener attached.

```js
ajax.register({ target: "a[data-ajax]", swaps: [...] })
ajax.register({ target: "#nav a", swaps: [...] })
```

---

### `swaps`

```ts
swaps: TargetConfig[]
```

An array of swap instructions. Each entry describes one element to update in the
current page using content from the fetched page. Multiple swaps run in order —
useful for updating a main content area and a sidebar in a single request.

See [TargetConfig](#targetconfig) below.

---

### `trigger`

```ts
trigger?: string | string[]
```

The DOM event(s) to listen for on matching elements. Defaults to `"click"` for
links and `"submit"` for forms. Pass a string or an array to listen for multiple
events.

```js
// fire on both focus and click
ajax.register({ target: "#btn", trigger: ["mouseenter", "click"], swaps: [...] })
```

---

### `transitions`

```ts
transitions?: string[]
```

Type names passed to the [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API)
(`document.startViewTransition({ types })`). Use these to drive CSS `@keyframes`
tied to `::view-transition-*` pseudo-elements.

If the browser does not support `startViewTransition`, the swap runs without any
transition — no polyfill, no error.

```js
ajax.register({
  target: "#link-about",
  transitions: ["slide-left"],
  swaps: [...],
})
```

```css
@keyframes slide-in {
  from { translate: 100% 0; }
}

::view-transition-new(*):active-view-transition-type(slide-left) {
  animation: slide-in 200ms ease;
}
```

---

### `plugins`

```ts
plugins?: Plugin[]
```

Per-registration plugins that run in addition to (or instead of) globally
registered plugins. A per-registration plugin with the same `key` as a global
plugin replaces it for this registration only.

```js
import ajax, { loading } from "@erikt/ajax"

ajax.use(loading())  // default: spinner on the triggering element

ajax.register({
  target: "#search-form",
  plugins: [loading("#search-spinner")],  // override for this registration only
  swaps: [{ replace: "#results" }],
})
```

See the [Plugins](/api/plugins) page for the full plugin interface.

---

### `prevent`

```ts
prevent?: boolean
```

Whether to call `e.preventDefault()` on the triggering event. Defaults to
`true`, which is the right behaviour for links and forms (stops the browser from
navigating). Set to `false` only if you need the default browser action to also
run.

---

## TargetConfig

Each entry in `swaps` is a `TargetConfig`:

### `replace`

```ts
replace: string
```

CSS selector for the element(s) in the **current page** to update. All matching
elements are updated.

---

### `with`

```ts
with?: string | string[]
```

CSS selector(s) to find the replacement content in the **fetched page**. The
first selector that matches wins. Defaults to the value of `replace` when
omitted.

Pass an array as a fallback chain — useful when the fetched page might not always
include the same element:

```js
{ replace: "#sidebar", with: ["#sidebar-full", "#sidebar"] }
```

---

### `mode`

```ts
mode?: 'innerHTML' | 'outerHTML' | 'beforebegin' | 'afterbegin' | 'beforeend' | 'afterend'
```

How content is inserted. Defaults to `"innerHTML"`.

| Mode | Effect |
|---|---|
| `innerHTML` | Replace the inner content, keep the wrapper element |
| `outerHTML` | Replace the element itself |
| `beforebegin` | Insert before the element |
| `afterbegin` | Insert as the first child |
| `beforeend` | Insert as the last child |
| `afterend` | Insert after the element |

---

### `if`

```ts
if?: (current: Element, next: Element) => boolean
```

A guard function called for each matched element before the swap runs. Return
`false` to skip the swap for that element. Useful for conditional updates — for
example, skipping a swap when the new content is identical:

```js
{
  replace: "#cart-count",
  if: (current, next) => current.textContent !== next.textContent,
}
```
